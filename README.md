# Efficient-Frontier: Applying financial theory to code

Throughout university there has always been an emphasis on finding the efficient frontier with regards to investing. I.e. an optimal portfolio where it is appleaing to all risk averse investors (low risk, high return). The core idea of this calulation is to find the optimal weights of each stock that form an ideal portfolio with a low standard deviation and a high expected return.


I have chosen to create a portfolio with the "Big 5" banks in Australia: ANZ, CBA, MQG, NAB and WBC.

The process I had taken was calculate %change for each stock. Also calculate daily, annual returns and covariance of the stocks. Set the number of combinations for imaginary portfolios (100,000)

Compute an 'efficent frontier' that found the optimal weights to be:
